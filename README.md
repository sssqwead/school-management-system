This School Management System is a Python project with SQLite that allows managing students, teachers, courses, and registrations through simple CRUD operations. It is designed as a lightweight, easy-to-use application that demonstrates how databases can be used in real school settings to organize and store information. The project is mainly for learning purposes and can be expanded with new features such as reports, attendance, or grading.
